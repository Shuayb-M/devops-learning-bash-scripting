## Challenge 1: Basic Arithmetic Calculator

**Challenge:** 
Create a script that takes two numbers as input and performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).

**Requirements:** 

- Prompt user for two numbers
- Perform all four operations
- Display the results
- Handle division by zero

**Example output:** 

Enter first number: 10 Enter second number: 5

Results: 10 + 5 = 15 10 - 5 = 5 10 × 5 = 50 10 ÷ 5 = 2


**Solution:**
```
STEP1:

STEP2:


```

**Explanation:**

<!-- - ls readme, command is used to list files and folders in the directory

- cat ./- , cat command outputs the contents of files in the terminal while we tell Linux exactly where the file is by using its full path.

**What I learned:** 

<!-- - If we were to open the file like this: cat -, Linux gets confused and doesn’t open the file. Linux thinks - means “this is an option,” not a filename.

- Some file names confuse Linux (like -). So we use ./ to be very clear. When you use ./ you are telling Linux: 👉 “Open - that is right here in this folder” -->
