## Challenge 3: File Checker with Permissions


**Challenge:** 

Create a script that checks if a file exists and displays its permissions.


**Requirements:** 

Prompt user for a filename
Check if the file exists
If it exists, check if it's readable, writable, and executable
Display appropriate messages for each permission


**Example output:** 

Enter filename to check: /etc/passwd

File '/etc/passwd' exists. ✓ File is readable ✓ File is writable ✗ File is not executable


**Solution:**

**Explanation:**

<!-- - ls readme, command is used to list files and folders in the directory

- cat ./- , cat command outputs the contents of files in the terminal while we tell Linux exactly where the file is by using its full path.

**What I learned:** 

<!-- - If we were to open the file like this: cat -, Linux gets confused and doesn’t open the file. Linux thinks - means “this is an option,” not a filename.

- Some file names confuse Linux (like -). So we use ./ to be very clear. When you use ./ you are telling Linux: 👉 “Open - that is right here in this folder” -->
